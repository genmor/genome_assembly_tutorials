PacBio HiFi is a relatively new sequencing platform which has the benefits of high accuracy (similar to Illumina) and read length (up to 25 kbp). A number of genome assemblers have been written or re-written to handle this read type. Here, I will link to the assemblers that I've used and provide an example script to run each program.
