# What do you mean by quality?
Assembling a genome is an involved process. Whether you've written your own pipeline to work with the latest and greatest programs, or simply followed a tutorial, it's no easy feat, and you should be proud of yourself for having accomplished that. So, how does your hard work look? By this, I mean **contiguity**, **completeness**, and **accuracy**. These are important metrics that need to be considered because your new assembly is supposed to be a representation of the genome of the sequenced individual, and naturally, you want this to reflect reality. A "real" genome doesn't have contigs floating around in the nucleusâ€”genomic sequences are localized to a chromosome. A genome that you assembled is VERY unlikely to have come together to form exactly the number of chromosomes present in your organism

1. Contiguity (N50, N90, L50, L90, # of contigs).
